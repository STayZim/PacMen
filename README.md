# PacMen Exercise

<img src="Images/PacMan1.png" width="300"/>

This project uses JavaScript, HTML and images files to create interactive mouseclick buttons to call a factory function to create the "PacMan" image upon every click.  The second button animates those images using programatic coding to define velocity and direction within defined coordinates.

How To Run

Click and drag the index.html file into the browser.  There will be two buttons displayed.  The first will "Add PacMen" button adds images to the screen and the second will "Start Game" button will make the PacMan image move around the screen.  The speed and direction of the movement is random and the user can create multiple PacMen.  Reload the browser page to restart the game.

Roadmap Of Future Improvments

Multiple PacMan image views are included in this file, and those images could be sustituted or altered.  The images could be randomly selected and the speed adjusted.  The screen background could be changed.  It could also be possible to code for collisions between PacMen.
